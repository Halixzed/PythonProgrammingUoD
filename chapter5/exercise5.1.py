# This is needed for the tests. This is now the first bit of code Python will run. 
# Please ask if you are curious, but it is enough to understand that this calls the main() function and runs whatever code you have in there.

 main() # calls the main function
 
 # uncomment the following lines to test calc_retail_price when you run the program.
 # you will need to comment out main() 
 # print(calc_retail_price(3.00, 100)) # should print 6.0
 # calc_retail_price(5.00, 50) # should print 7.5
#print(calc_retail_price(3.00, 100))
